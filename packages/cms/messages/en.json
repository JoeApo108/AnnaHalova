      "Here I share with you my passion for painting. In a painting, I feel, I can express what is unfolding in the field of perception.",
      "I have been painting since childhood. Along the way I tried drawing and printmaking, sculpture, media, writing – and returned to what I love most.",
      "There is not much to write about. No grand thinking, sketches or preparations. I paint when it comes to me. I don't know the next stroke myself, nor the final form of the work. Creation is a wondrous Moment; a living, pulsating pause.",
      "For me, painting is an adventurous journey. Come with me for a while and take a look.."
